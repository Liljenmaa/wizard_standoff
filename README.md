A script that runs a simulation of the wizard standoff described in further detail in the linked YouTube-video.
If you want to test other configurations mentioned in the video, change the line:

wizardlist.append(Wizard(100, 0))

to either:

wizardlist.append(Wizard(80, 0))

or

wizardlist.append(Wizard(60, 0))
