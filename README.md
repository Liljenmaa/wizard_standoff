Three scripts that run a simulation of the wizard standoff described in further detail in the linked YouTube-video.

Every action performed is the best available.

As you might notice when running the proof, the chance for the Gaussian wand to win is not 32.3%, but rather closer to 20.6%

Also, whichever apple basket you choose (at the end of the video), you have a 30% fatality rate.
